## Holiday Units

| Unit | Description |
|-|-|
| **Tree Basher** | Haven't you ever where the trees you throw away after Christmas go? These elves wield fearsome trees! |
| **Nutcracker** | They really do come to life! This haunted redcoat marches with a vengeance, smacking enemies in the face with a star. |
| **Rocking Horse** | A flying rocking horse ridden by an enthusiastic, garland-throwing elf, wrapping up its enemies like trees till they collapse. |
| **Jingle Bells** | Using the power of three elves together, this elf stack summons bells! They crush enemies and leave them stunned. |
| **Snow Roller** | Summoning snow from thin air? Easy! Anything can get caught in the ever-growing snowballs of the elf armies. |
| **Candypult** | Who needs elf soldiers when you can throw gingerbread houses? Entire families of Gingerbread warriors fight units, with cookie and cane! |
| ***GIFT BRINGER*** | Ho ho ho! Whether you've been naughty or nice, Santa will still fire explosive elves from a cannon at you. At the very least, they fire gifts out of a gun, which deal devastating damage.. Be good, kids!  |

## Secret Units

| Unit | Location | Description |
|-|-|-|
| **S'more Knight** | *Farmer Snow* | More like some more knight, am I right? ..Anyway, this marshmallow man covered in cookie armor uses the power of cookies to crush, push, and block enemies, along with cutting them using a frozen hot chocolate blade! |
| **Snow Cannon** | *Farmer Snow* | Elf machinery has advanced, now they're launching snowglobes! This snow elf brings down snowflake rain, freezing armies. |
| ***JOLLY-BOT*** | *Farmer Snow* | Behold, the peak of elf craftsmanship, the ultimate mech! Mounted to its right arm is a Gatling gun firing an assortment of toys, and on its left, a gun firing massive gifts that block armies. From its chest is a cannon that shoots clusters of explosive ornaments.  |
