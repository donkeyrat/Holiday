## Holiday Units

| Unit | Description |
|-|-|
| **Decorator** | An enthusiastic, garland-throwing elf, wrapping up its enemies like trees till they collapse. |
| **Tree Basher** | Haven't you ever where the trees you throw away after Christmas go? These elves wield fearsome trees! |
| **Snowman** | They really do come to life! This haunted pile of snow summons cages of icy fury to trap opponents eternally.. or at least for a few seconds. |
| **Star Bearer** | The elf that tops the trees! Their light pushes back the naughty ones. |
| **Snow Roller** | Summoning snow from thin air? Easy! Anything can get caught in the ever-growing snowballs of the elf armies. |
| **Candypult** | Who needs elf soldiers when you can throw gingerbread houses? Entire families of Gingerbread warriors fight units, with cookie and cane! |
| ***GIFT BRINGER*** | Ho ho ho! Whether you've been naughty or nice, Santa will still fire explosive elves from a cannon at you. At the very least, they rain down gifts from above, although they contain elves that throw snowballs.. Be good, kids!  |
